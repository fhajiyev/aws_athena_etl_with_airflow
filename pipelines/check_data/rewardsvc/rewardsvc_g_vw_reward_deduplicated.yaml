# The dag validates deduplicated view rewardsvc.g_vw_reward for rewardsvc.g_stream_reward
# augend: If g_vw_reward has vanished records from g_stream_reward, augend value has positive integer 
# addend: If g_vw_reward has duplicated records per unique keys (account_id, version), addend value has positive integer
# augend + addend must be zero
