# This pipeline checks whether bs_allocation_dau was generated properly within the allowed SLO
# Thus, this DAG does not have upstream_dependency on redshift_query_bs_allocation_dau

# SLO = 3 hours after midnight kst
# SLO is subject to change
# - INTERVAL '20 HOURS' + INTERVAL '24 HOURS' is required to match the cron schedule
